# short.ly
Shortly is a simple URL shortener (still WIP) that makes long urls not only shorter, but easy to remember.
Rather than returning a jumbled string of characters (i.e. `short.ly/i1jRPq24W`), it will create a url where the
extension is made of 3 words (i.e. `short.ly/AppleHouseDog`), which makes the URLs much easier to remember.
